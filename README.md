# Crazyflie Project

## Setup
Clone this repo along with the crazyflie ROS repo and the forked (with minor changes) Bitcraze Loco Positioning repo into your catkin workspace

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/jolilj/el2425_bitcraze.git
git clone https://github.com/jolilj/lps-ros.git
git clone https://github.com/whoenig/crazyflie_ros.git
```
Make and source

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

## Hardware notes

### Radio addresses
To change the radio address of the Crazyflie, use the CFclient (easiest through the [virtual machine](https://www.bitcraze.io/getting-started-with-the-crazyflie-2-0/#inst-comp) to avoid installing a lot of dependencies). Instructions [here](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:crazyflie:client:pycfclient:index#firmware_configuration). Go to firmware configuration section.

Crazyflie 0 URI:
`radio://0/125/2M/E7E7E7E7E7`

Crazyflie 1 URI:
`radio://0/125/2M/E7E7E7E7BC`

It might be possible to change the config file in `crazyflie-firmware/src/config/config.h`.
We haven't tried this though.

## Flying
In order to hover you need to update the crazyflie firmware config. This is done by creating a config.mk file and place it inside `crazyflie-firmware/tools/make`. The file is now in this repo and consists only of two lines. The reason is to enable the kalman filter onboard the crazyflie. See [bitcraze wiki](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:lps:index) for more information.

**The instructions on how to fly one or multiple drones are to be found in the `instructions.md` file.**
